**a.** The logo assigned to the site aims to bring a _cozy_ and _user-friendly_ 
aesthetic in order to contribute to the user's immersion in the thematic digital 
environment.

will be used.

**c.** The fonts for text will have a _rounded nature_ to contribute to the theme 
chosen for the site, in order to collaborate with the _non-tiring reading_ of the 
same.

**d.** The style of the site was chosen and inspired by _themed cafes_, the theme 
in question for this site is "_cat café_".
