### Visual Identification

**a.** The logo assigned to the site aims to bring a cozy and user-friendly 
aesthetic in order to contribute to the user's immersion in the thematic digital 
environment.

**b.** The color palette was chosen thinking about promoting visual comfort to the 
user, so the colors of an earth-toned palette with contrast from a cool-toned palette 
will be used.

**c.** The fonts for text will have a rounded nature to contribute to the theme 
chosen for the site, in order to collaborate with the non-tiring reading of the 
same.

## Introduction

### Purpose
**a.** The goal of the project is to create a site capable of carrying out and storing 
data of a user, show a complete catalog of products, redirect the user to the payment 
window, and send the information to the restaurant so that it can place and deliver 
the order to the customer.
